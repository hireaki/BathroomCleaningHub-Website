            1. Remove anything stored on the top of the tank and be sure your supplies are handy.
<br>
<br>
2. Flush the toilet with the lid closed to wet the bowl. Wearing rubber gloves, add the toilet bowl cleaner as close to the toilet rim as possible to cover the bowl.
<br>
<br>
3. Always begin scrubbing under the bowl rim first with the toilet brush. The water jets can get clogged and may require additional cleaning steps to be sure that the toilet is getting enough water to flush properly. Next, scrub the bowl including the drain hole opening at the bottom of the bowl to remove stains. Flush the toilet with the lid down.
<br>
<br>
4. Raise the seat and spray the top and bottom of the seat, the inside lid, and the rim of the toilet with disinfecting bathroom cleaner. Give the product a few minutes to work and then wipe it away. Don't forget to clean the outside of the lid. Finish by wiping the seat with a clean damp cloth or paper towel to remove any traces of bleach or chemicals from the sitting surface.
<br>
<br>
5. Clean the outside of the toilet with a disinfecting bathroom cleaner. Start at the top and spray the tank, handle, and bowl edges. Give the product a few minutes to work and wipe the surfaces with a cloth or paper towel. Finally, wipe down the entire outside of the bowl. Start with the sides and front before cleaning the bottom edges of the toilet where it meets the floor.
<br>
<br>
6. To finish up, clean up any drips of cleaner or water that may have landed on the floor. Clean the toilet brush and holder. Replace items that you moved before beginning to clean.
