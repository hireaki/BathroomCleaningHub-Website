            1. Get rid of loose dirt. All tile floors need to be vacuumed or swept before they’re washed. Because many tile materials can scratch easily, use a vacuum attachment with soft bristles or a soft-bristle broom to remove dirt, dust, hair and debris. If your vacuum doesn’t have a bare floor attachment, check if the brush roll can be turned off. Use a handheld broom in tight corners and along the edges of the room to help maintain tile floors between washing.

2. Mix a mild detergent and water in a large bucket. Less is more when adding detergent to your water as too much can make rinsing difficult. For the right ratio, mix ¼ cup of a mild detergent, into 1 gallon of water.
<br>
<br>
3. Submerge a microfiber mop or cloth in the solution. While it’s tempting to grab a sponge to quickly wash your bathroom tile floor by hand, you could end up with unsightly streaks or water spots if you’re using too much water. Since sponges naturally retain water, it’s best to use a microfiber cloth or microfiber mop and a bucket so you can squeeze out excess water or a spray mop where you dispense the cleaning solution as you work. For larger floors, work in sections to reduce the amount of water you need to get the job done.
<br>
<br>
4. Rinse thoroughly. To help make your floors shine, change the water in the bucket frequently and wipe away any leftover cleaning solution. Rinse your mop or cloth completely then use it to wipe a section clean. Repeat until the whole floor looks squeaky clean.
<br>
<br>
5. Dry to avoid spots. Unglazed tiles can be left to air dry, but we recommend wiping glazed tiles with a clean, dry microfiber cloth to prevent water spots.
