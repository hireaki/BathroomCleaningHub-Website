            1. Soak your shower head.
Use a plastic food bag to soak your shower head overnight for effortless removal of lime scale and soap scum.  
Just fill the bag with white vinegar and a few drops of lemon essential oil (I love this brand), and secure the bag on your shower head with a rubber band or elastic hair tie. 
<br>
<br>
2. Get streak-free mirrors – without chemical cleaners.
Just wet an E-Cloth Microfiber or Polishing Cloth with tap water, and wring it out to remove as much water as you can.  
Wipe your mirror thoroughly to remove any dirt, hairspray, and other gunk. Then, use a dry polishing cloth to buff out any streaks.  
The cloths remove dirt and bacteria for a safe clean without any dangerous chemicals!
<br>
<br>
3. Clean and disinfect your floor – with water!
Just like the microfiber cloths, the close knit of the fabric actually cleans and disinfects better than conventional cleaners without any dangerous chemicals! 
Just soak the mop cloth in clean water, then wring it out until it’s no longer dripping wet. Attach the mop head to the handle, and you’re ready to scrub your floor. 
Rinse and repeat as much as you need to until all the dirt is gone. 
<br>
<br>
4. Keep drains clear.
To keep pipes clear, pour boiling water down your drains once per week. This method works best on metal pipes.  
Boiling water may be too hot for PVC pipes, so if you have those, just use the hottest water that comes from your tap.
<br>
<br>
5. Prevent clogs before they happen.
You won’t need to deal with clogged drains again when you use a tub drain hair catcher that lets water flow freely while catching those pesky hairs for easy removal. 
<br>
<br>
6. Nix water spots.
Rub a cut, fresh lemon on chrome fixtures to easily remove water spots, let it sit for a few minutes, then, rinse with water and a microfiber cloth. 
This method can be used anywhere in the home, but is especially great at removing mineral deposits and soap scum in the bathroom.
Just make sure to test on colorful surfaces , since lemon can fade certain colors.
<br>
<br>
7. Clean your toilet.
Mix 1/4 cup baking soda with 1 cup of white vinegar in the toilet bowl. Let the fizzing action subside before using your toilet brush to scrub clean. 
Allow the mixture sit in the toilet for 5-10 minutes to freshen before flushing. 
<br>
<br>
8. Clean dirty grout.
Clean it up by making a thick paste with baking soda and vinegar. Apply the mixture to your grout, and scrub it into the grout with an old toothbrush and some good, old fashioned elbow grease.
