            1. Start by checking out your showerhead closely. Turn on the water, and identify which water holes seem plugged when the shower is running. Make sure those affected holes are completely submerged while cleaning.
<br>
<br>
2. Place the gallon-size plastic bag, open, inside the pitcher, and fold the edges of the bag around the outside of the container. This helps to keep it upright. Add 1/2 cup of baking soda to the bag.
<br>
<br>
3. Slowly pour the vinegar into the bag. Without causing the bag to overflow, continue adding the vinegar until it’s fully mixed and settled. Add 1 cup of water to dilute the mixture.
<br>
<br>
4. Submerge showerhead. A zip tie is a very secure way to attach the bag around the neck of your showerhead. You can also use a rubber band if you’re able to wrap it well and keep the bag in place. Be mindful of the bag's weight, too; if you have a small showerhead, you may want to reduce the amount of cleaner weighing down your fixture. (Just pour any excess onto the floor of the bathtub or shower and give the area a good washing while you’re at it.) Allow the showerhead to soak in the cleaner for four hours, or even overnight.
<br>
<br>
5. Wipe down the showerhead surface to remove mineral deposits. When you remove the bag, pour the liquid down the drain and turn the water back on to see if any of the previously clogged jets have opened up. If your showerhead produced a low water pressure prior to cleaning, you might notice a big difference now.
<br>
<br>
6. Use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe down the surface of the showerhead gently to wash away any remaining mineral build-up or residue on the metal or plastic. Soap residue and hard water spots should be completely gone, and your shower should be good to use again.
