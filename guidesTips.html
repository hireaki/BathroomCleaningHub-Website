            1. Give yourself a head start.
            <br>
Apply toilet cleaner around the toilet rim and leave it to work its magic while you get on with all the other jobs. Return armed with a stiff-bristled toilet brush and give the bowl a good scrub, then flush.
<br>
<br>
2. If you’re using bleach, chill out!
<br>
Unless you’re going entirely green with your routine, bleach is on most bathroom cleaning checklists. Whether you use it diluted to swirl around the sink or you use a stronger bleach solution to whiten grout, you could be making the common mistake of using it with warm water.
Always use cold water with bleach as hot water can deactivate it, making it useless.
GHI Tip: If you’re using chemical cleaners, keep your bath window and doors wide open throughout to help disperse fumes.
<br>
<br>
3. Onwards and upwards.
<br>
Over time your bathroom fan can grow a furry covering of unsightly dust. Vacuum or brush away the fluff from the filter and clean the rest with soap and water on a damp cloth. Be careful not to wet any of the internal fittings. If the grill is removable, soak it in soapy water for a more thorough clean. Rinse, dry, and voila!
<br>
<br>
4. Say no to smelly bins!
<br>
Freshen the inside of your empty bin, then spray with disinfectant and wipe dry. If the inside of the bin needs more attention than a quick freshen, hose it down in the shower after emptying to get rid of product residues and dirt.
<br>
<br>
5. Brighten your bath in minutes.
<br>
Try rinsing the bath straight after a soaking, as left-over bubble bath and oils are a menace to remove once dried on. To tackle tidemarks and built-up grime, spray liberally with bathroom cleaner, and walk away. Let the cleaning agent work for at least 15 minutes before wiping and rinsing.
If your tub is very dirty, fill it with warm water, add a couple of scoops of biological washing powder and leave it overnight. Rinse thoroughly before bathing.
<br>
<br>
6. Fabulous floors in a flash!
<br>
Keep dust at bay by giving the room a quick once-over with a hand-held vacuum cleaner every other day. Alternatively, use an antibacterial wipe to remove dust bunnies with ease but do not flush used wipes down your toilet.
Avoid foamy floor cleaner in favour of spray, liquid cleaners (or an e-cloth mop) to prevent a residue that'll dull the floor and invite future grime.
<br>
<br>
7. Prevent plughole disasters.
<br>
To keep drains running freely, pour a cup of soda crystals followed by boiling water down the plughole. This will help clear grease, soap scum and banish odours, too. Remember to wear rubber gloves to avoid skin irritation!
You can also slug vinegar and bicarbonate down the plug to dissolve any dirt, meanwhile, lemon juice can help remove strong smells. Finish off the job with lots of hot water.
GHI Tip: Try to bottlebrush your plugholes once a week. 
<br>
<br>
8. Keep limescale at bay.
<br>
Never use abrasive cleaners on taps. Instead, remove limescale by soaking a cloth in a solution of equal parts white vinegar and water and wrap it around the spout (or use a descaling product and follow the instructions). Leave for a few hours before removing the cloth, then rinse well with water and blot dry to avoid splash marks. Wipe with a disinfectant to finish.
Keep vinegar well away from gold taps and marble surrounds!
GHI Tip: If you don’t like that vinegary smell, you can follow the same process using lemon juice.
<br>
<br>
9. Unclog the shower head.
<br>
Pour a solution of half distilled vinegar, half water into a plastic bag and fasten it over your showerhead with an elastic band. Make sure the holes are immersed in the liquid. After an hour, remove the bag and run the shower on hot to flush the showerhead through.
Finally, use a needle to de-clog any spray holes that are still blocked. Your shower pressure will be up to scratch in no time!
<br>
<br>
10. Run regular spot-checks!
<br>
Keep a microfibre cloth handy in the bathroom at all times to quickly rub off toothpaste splatters, watermarks and other stains before they dry and become harder to remove. We like the e-cloth range. You only need to add water, so no chemicals are required.
